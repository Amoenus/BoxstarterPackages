    <summary>Installs Docker for Windows including Docker service.</summary>
    <description>
This installer is fully baked and tested, and comes with the **latest GA version** of Docker Engine along with [experimental features in Docker Engine](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/experimental/README.md), which are enabled by default and configurable on [Docker Daemon settings for experimental mode](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/index#daemon-experimental-mode). 

This is the best channel to use if you want a reliable platform to work with. (Be sure to disable experimental features for apps in production.) 

These releases follow a version schedule with a longer lead time than the Edge releases, synched with Docker Engine releases and hotfixes.

On the Stable channel, you can select whether to send usage statistics and other data.

> ## Important Notes:
> * Docker for Windows requires 64bit Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise and Education (1511 November update, Build 10586 or later) and Microsoft Hyper-V. Please see [What to know before you install](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#what-to-know-before-you-install) for a full list of prerequisites.
> * You can switch between Edge and Stable versions, but you must have only one app installed at a time. Also, you will need to save images and export containers you want to keep before uninstalling the current version before installing another. For more about this, see the [FAQs about Stable and Edge channels](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/faqs/#questions-about-stable-and-edge-channels). 
> * The installer that is used is **always the latest version** and therby not tied to the version of this package.
