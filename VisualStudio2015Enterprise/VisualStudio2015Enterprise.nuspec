      ### Customizations
      You can customize the installation either by adding optional available features or by specifying own installation configuration file.

      #### Adding optional features
      Optional features (Sql tools, phone tools, etc.) are available but not installed by default.
      You can provide optional parameters to include them during the install.
      Here is example that includes the Sql Tools and Windows Phone Emulators:

      choco install VisualStudio2015Enterprise -ia "/InstallSelectableItems SQL;WindowsPhone81Emulators"

      ##### Available features:
      - LightSwitch
      - MDDCPlusPlus
      - MDDJS
      - OfficeDeveloperTools
      - SilverLight_Developer_Kit
      - SQL
      - ToolsForWin81_WP80_WP81
      - VC_MFC_Libraries
      - WindowsPhone81Emulators

      See for more details: http://timsneath.com/visual-studio-2015-installation-options/ or dig your way through the feed: http://download.microsoft.com/download/4/E/3/4E353239-F3A6-4C1F-BEF2-7DB062D0A5C4/20151211.2/enu/feed.xml.

      #### Using own configuration file
      Specifying the optional features above modifies the configuration file used during installation (AdminDeployment.xml). If that is not enough you can provide this file on your own.
      Example:

      choco install VisualStudio2015Enterprise -ia "/AdminFile c:\path to your\AdminDeployment.xml"
      
      #### Offline installation
      Specify the layout location as package parameter to be download and update the layout and install from there with the following command: choco install VisualStudio2015Enterprise -params "/layout C:\VS2015".
