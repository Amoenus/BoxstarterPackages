    <summary>Installs Docker for Windows including Docker service.</summary>
    <description>
This installer provides the **latest Edge release** of Docker for Windows, offers cutting edge features along with [experimental features in Docker Engine](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/experimental/README.md), which are enabled by default and configurable on [Docker Daemon settings for experimental mode](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/index#daemon-experimental-mode). 

This is the best channel to use if you want to experiment with features under development, and can weather some instability and bugs. This channel is a continuation of the Edge program, where you can provide feedback as the apps evolve. Releases are typically more frequent than for Stable, often one or more per month. 

We collect all usage data on Edge releases across the board.   

> ## Important Notes:
> * Docker for Windows requires 64bit Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise and Education (1511 November update, Build 10586 or later) and Microsoft Hyper-V. Please see [What to know before you install](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#what-to-know-before-you-install) for a full list of prerequisites.
> * You can switch between Edge and Stable versions, but you must have only one app installed at a time. Also, you will need to save images and export containers you want to keep before uninstalling the current version before installing another. For more about this, see the [FAQs about Stable and Edge channels](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/faqs/#questions-about-stable-and-edge-channels). 
> * The installer that is used is **always the latest version** and therby not tied to the version of this package.
