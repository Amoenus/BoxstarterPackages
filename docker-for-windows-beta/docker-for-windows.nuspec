    <summary>Installs Docker for Windows including Docker service.</summary>
    <description>
An integrated, easy-to-deploy environment for building, assembling, and shipping applications from a Windows PC, Docker for Windows is a native Windows application with a native user interface and auto-update capability, deeply integrated with Windows native virtualization, Hyper-V, networking and file system, making it faster and more reliable than previous ways of getting Docker on a Windows PC.   

Requires Microsoft Windows 10 Professional or Enterprise 64-bit
For previous versions get [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox) (no package yet).

## Note:
This installer offers cutting edge features and comes with the experimental version of Docker Engine, which is described in the [Docker Experimental Features README](https://github.com/docker/docker/tree/master/experimental) on GitHub.

This is the best channel to use if you want to experiment with features we are working on as they become available, and can weather some instability and bugs. This channel is a continuation of the beta program, where you can provide feedback as the apps evolve. Releases are typically more frequent than for stable, often one or more per month.

## Note:
This packages uses a direct download link to the specific beta version!
